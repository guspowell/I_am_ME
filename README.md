## Synopsis

In our final two weeks at Makers Academy we have final projects in which we work as a team of five to produce a working web app.

Our project involved working for a client who had envisioned a new way of discovering, saving and sharing events around you in an aesthetic, clean and readable way. Their idea was called iamME, they had a clear picture of what it was, and we were tasked with creating it and pushing it one step closer to reality.

In short, the idea is you can create calendars based on your interests and then follow businesses, artists, friends to get an events feed tailored to you.

## Going Forward

Given our time frame and the scale of the project our clients came to us with, unfortunately we were not able to complete the app. Having said that, I am extremely pleased with what we did manage to produce.
